Project Title:
Analyzing Electric Vehicle Buyers: Insights into Adoption Trends and Buyer Segmentation

Objective:
To explore patterns in electric vehicle (EV) purchases, identify key factors influencing adoption, and segment buyers based on demographics, preferences, and purchasing behavior. The goal is to provide actionable insights for automakers, dealers, and policymakers to accelerate EV adoption.

Description:
This project uses a dataset of EV buyers containing demographic, geographic, financial, and behavioral attributes (e.g., income level, location, vehicle type, purchase date, charging habits). Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, the study investigates how factors such as price sensitivity, environmental awareness, and charging infrastructure availability affect EV adoption. The project also applies clustering techniques to segment EV buyers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.

Key Steps:

Data Acquisition & Cleaning

Import raw buyer datasets from CSV/API sources.

Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.

Standardize categorical variables (e.g., region, vehicle model).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends in EV adoption over time.

Analyze purchase patterns by age group, income level, and location.

Identify correlations between features (e.g., battery range vs. buyer location).

Buyer Segmentation

Apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group buyers.

Interpret cluster characteristics (e.g., “Eco-conscious Urban Professionals,” “Budget Suburban Adopters”).

Predictive Modeling

Build classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict likelihood of EV purchase.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Business Insights & Recommendations

Suggest tailored marketing strategies for each buyer segment.

Recommend infrastructure investments to improve adoption rates in low-penetration areas.

Tools & Technologies:

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

SQL for querying buyer data from relational databases

Tableau/Power BI for dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Expected Outcomes:

Clear visualization of EV adoption trends.

Data-driven buyer personas for targeted outreach.

Predictive model for identifying potential EV customers.

Actionable recommendations to increase EV sales.
